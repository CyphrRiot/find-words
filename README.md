## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Customize worker count (default: CPU cores × 2)
export FIND_WORDS_WORKERS=16

# Set memory limit (default: auto-detected)
export FIND_WORDS_MAX_MEMORY=4GB

# Enable debug mode
export FIND_WORDS_DEBUG=1
```

### Performance Tuning

For very large datasets, you can optimize performance:

```bash
# Increase worker count for I/O bound workloads
find-words --workers=32 search terms

# Process only smaller files first
find-words --max-size=10MB search terms

# Skip binary file detection for speed
find-words --skip-binary-check search terms
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No files found":**

- Check if you're in the right directory
- Try adding `--code` flag for programming files
- Verify search terms are spelled correctly

**"Out of memory":**

- The tool automatically optimizes memory usage
- For extremely large datasets, it processes files in chunks
- Memory usage is typically 50MB-1GB depending on dataset size

**"Slow performance":**

- Ensure you're using SSD storage for best results
- Large network drives may be slower
- Use `--workers` flag to optimize for your CPU

### Getting Help

- Use `find-words --help` for usage information
- Use `find-words --version` for version details
- Check the GitHub Issues page for known problems
- Performance issues are usually related to hardware or dataset size
